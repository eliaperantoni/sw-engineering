Notes for the Software Engineering Fundamentals 2022/2023 course @ UniVR Master's in Comp.Sci. Produced by merging different sources (my own paper notes, slides, [fabfabretti's awesome document](https://github.com/fabfabretti/sbobinamento-seriale-uniVR/tree/main/(2021-22)%20Fondamenti%20di%20Ingegneria%20del%20Software)) and through a continuous process of cleaning up, making explanations clearer and removing duplication. Because I wrote this document with the goal of making it as short as humanly possible, I don't recommend using it as your sole source of material.
